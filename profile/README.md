[Holo Interactive](https://holoi.com), formerly known as [Amber Garage](https://ambergarage.com), is a creative spatial computing lab founded by [Botao Amber Hu](https://botao.hu). As the innovative force behind HoloKit and various transformative mixed reality (MR) projects, Holo Interactive has successfully secured substantial funding from top-tier VCs in Silicon Valley and China. 

# HoloKit X
* 🥽 **Ingenious Invention**: We have released an optical see-through stereoscopic MR headset [HoloKit X](https://holokit.io) in 2022, which is an [award-winning](https://www.red-dot.org/project/holokit-x-64930) premium-quality upgrade from our original periscope-shaped invention [HoloKit 1](https://1.holokit.io/), a cardboard proof of concept released in 2017. 
* 📲 **Full AR Functionalities**: Without reinventing the wheel, our open-source, phone-based AR headset maximizes your smartphone's existing AR functionalities, such as [ARKit](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/arkit/arkit_in_ios), [6DOF Spatial Tracking](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/arkit/arworldtrackingconfiguration), [Hand Tracking](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/vision/detecting_hand_poses_with_vision), [Depth and Meshing by LiDAR](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/avfoundation/additional_data_capture/capturing_depth_using_the_lidar_camera), [Spatial Audio](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/arkit/), and [MultipeerConnectivity](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/multipeerconnectivity).
* 💲 **Accessible Immersion**: With a crystal-clear 60-degree FOV optics, experience a rich, immersive mixed reality that stands as a cost-effective alternative to 20-30x pricier options like [HoloLens](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/hololens/buy) and [Magic Leap](https://www.magicleap.com/buy-now).
* 🎨 **For Creators by Creators**: Tailored for quick and efficient MR creative project execution, especially in multiplayer scenarios, HoloKit, is a go-to tool for *MR researchers, educators, and creators*. See more [#MadeWithHolokit works](https://github.io/holoi/awesome-holokit) from our community.
 
# Getting started 

* Buy HoloKit on [our website](https://holokit.io/products/holokit-x) or [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/s?i=merchant-items&me=ASBKMHTMFQG2J).

# Getting inspired

Our team is a blend of MR researchers, educators, and creators, making us the quintessential users of HoloKit. Going beyond mere hardware, we are constantly at the forefront of experimenting and pioneering new creative paradigms in MR by leveraging HoloKit. By open-sourcing the majority of our innovations, we aim to inspire more people into the expansive realms of mixed reality.

## Co-located Multiplayer

Co-located Multiplayer represents an unique category in mixed reality scenarios. Utilizing multiple HoloKits provides a cost-effective alternative to using multiple HoloLenses in these scenarios. Moreover, Spectator View, offering a critical tool for capturing and documenting the MR experience from a third-person perspective, is also a special form of co-located multiplayer. Our team is committed to innovatively pushing the boundaries in the realm of co-located multiplayer.

* [Multiplayer Onsite Fighting Arena (MOFA)](https://mofa.ar) is a co-located multiplayer MR game framework for casting magic spells, in which we explored paradigms of competitive, cooperative, asymmetric mixed reality game design strategies crossing handheld and headmounted AR devices. Awarded as the [best interactivity demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mCHEdItEx2s) in [CHI 2023](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3544549.3583935), honorable mention in best demo in ISMAR 2023, and awarded at Flow Hackathon.

* [Apple Multipeer Connectivity Unity plugin](https://github.com/holoi/apple-multipeer-connectivity-unity-plugin) is a Unity Netcode Transport plugin for Apple Multipeer Connectivity, the tech behind Apple Airdrop, which is tailored for co-located multiplayer MR game to establish the low latency local networking. A specialized version of this plugin was also merged in [Unity's Multiplayer Community Contributions](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/multiplayer-community-contributions/tree/main/Transports/com.community.netcode.transport.multipeer-connectivity).

<!--
* [Adlocating](https://github.com/holoi/adlocating) is a Unity plugin for an on-device adhoc QRCode co-locating technology. 
-->

* We created multiplayer boilerplate for quick kickstarting your multiplayer MR project.
   * [HoloKit x Immersal Multiplayer Boilerplate](https://github.com/holoi/holokit-immersal-multiplayer-boilerplate) for co-located multiplayer in fixed scenes (pre-scanning required) with Spectator View using Immersal SDK and  on-based colocation technology. 
   * [HoloKit x Adlocating Multiplayer Boilerplate](https://github.com/holoi/holokit-adlocating-multiplayer-boilerplate) for co-located multiplayer in ad-hoc scenes (pre-scanning NOT required) with Spectator View using Adlocating, an on-device QRCode co-locating technology.
